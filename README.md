# US-Bikeshare-Data_Project
# In this project, we will write Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
# We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
# To answer these questions using Python, we will need to write a Python script. 
# We will need the three city dataset files too: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
